            This assignment, for CSCI 1300 at Brown University, instructed us to
            find a website that had design flaws and recreate it using HTML and
            CSS to be more responsive and user friendly.
          </li>
          <li>
            We also had to create lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes for our design on 3
            different screen sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            I chose the website of Fellini's Pizzeria, a local pizza restaurant,
            because it is a restaurant that I think makes good pizza, but which
            has a website that I have been frustrated with in the past.

          <h4>My Problems</h4>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Navigation bar is not fixed on computer, leading to unnecessary
            scrolling when navigating between parts of the site or when trying
            to order (Nav bar is fixed to the bottom on mobile).
          </li>
          <li>
            Unclear which button allows for online ordering: it only says
            Toasttab, the site used for online orders, and it has the same
            design as the other links.
          </li>
          <li>
            Online ordering button only allows for ordering at one location, it
            is unclear whether online ordering is supported for the other
            location.
          </li>
          <li>
            The hierarchy is off in the location information, with the contact
            label having the same header size as the restaurant names.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Slices header at the bottom of the Pizzas section is
            disconnected from the slice prices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tight 2 column layout for menu items on the computer can make it
            hard to scan the menu, since there are multiple lines per item.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="subsection-title">
          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          In addition to identifying our own problems, we ran the website
          through the WAVE accessibility checker to find other errors. Here are
          some of the most pressing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No page language tag</li>
          <li>2 empty heading tags</li>
          <li>
            2 cases of low contrast text (the text was over a sufficiently dark
            image that WAVE did not pick up on)
          </li>
          <li>Multiple skipped heading levels (no h2 between h1 and h3)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I thought these problems were generally valid, although the low
          contrast text was not really a problem if the image loaded correctly.
          I also noticed that the images were missing alt text, but wave did not
          pick up on that since they were displayed as the backgrounds of divs.
